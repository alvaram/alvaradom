    <p>Marcello Alvarado is a reliable and trustworthy web designer from Los Angeles. With over a decade of experience, Marcello has the expertise and vision to help you drive your business forward with exceptional brand design, product development, and strategic leadership.</p>
	<p>Just out of college, Marcello broke into the industry assisting the legendary Larry Flynt at Hustler Magazine. Marcello was tasked with creating and managing all of the websites on the Hustler Network while conceptualizing and communicating Flynt’s vision into a usable form. While this was a large amount of work, Marcello flourished in this position, learned how to manage his time, and how to create high-quality websites quickly.</p>
	<p>After 5 years Marcello transitioned to a Lead Designer role with LottoGopher.com, where he lead all product design for the first website that allowed US consumers to buy official state lottery tickets online. It was critical for Marcello to facilitate an experience that was superior to consumers—after all, most lottery players have a routine and are notoriously superstitious with their methodology. Marcello designed performance-based pages from initial design to development as well as assisted with on- and offline marketing efforts. This multifaceted role allowed Marcello to develop problem-solving and leadership skills.</p>
	<p>Marcello’s time with LottoGopher.com was so positive that he later became the Director of Design for the firm, giving him experience working with C-Suite leadership on expansion and acquisitions in addition to his normal design and development duties. Under his guidance, LottoGopher.com improved retention and metrics by focusing on KPIs/OKRs and driving exceptional customer service. Marcello was then promoted again to VP of Operations, assisting with longer-term projects with an eye on sustained success in a competitive space.</p>
	<p>Even with all of the success Marcello has had, he has a passion for working with startups. What some see as grunt work, Marcello sees as an opportunity to expand his skillset to a well-rounded web designer and leader. Building teams and developing talent has come naturally to Marcello. He regularly Freelances with businesses, and his clients appreciate the perfectionism, reliability, and professionalism that separate Marcello from his peers in the industry.</p>
	<p>When not hard at work delivering for his clients, Marcello is often found spending time with his wife and their dogs. After long periods in front of a screen in a building, Marcello recharges himself by exploring the wilderness, camping, or playing Frisbee Golf. He loves to connect with like-minded individuals inside and outside of his industry and looks forward to helping you achieve your goals through exceptional design.</p>
	<p>Marcello's available for freelance Shopify projects, as well as private contracting gigs.
