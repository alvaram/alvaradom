## Life 

- **You're only as good as your last show**: No matter what you've accomplished in life, you're last spectacle is what others will perceive you by. So always do your best in everything you do.
- **Do NOT trust anyone**: Hypothetically speaking. You come across many people in your life and deciphering between who to trust is sometimes hard to choose from. I've learned if you trust no one, you will always be in good company. Don't think about it too much, you'll know.
- **Do NOT Lie**: You'll be happier; it will get you further in life.
