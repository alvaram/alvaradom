title: "Toptal Cover Letter (informal)"
---

I'm writing this blog post, as not only is this my FIRST blog post, but I think it can be a great case for me to kick-off my blog, to get started writing more and what not better way to do this, by explaining why I think I'm qualified to be in the **top 3%** of freelance designers and worthy to be on the platform [Toptal][web-ui-ux].

If you haven't already peaked around [here][about] and [there][bio] to get to know a little more about me, please do and with that, I will continue where that leaves off from. Since I went freelance 3 years ago, I've been fortunate to work with several startup companies, where one even went Public on the Canadian Stock Exchange. During this time, I grew in so many ways, as many know working in a startup is not necessary the same as working at a bigger company or smaller company at that. You need to put on your big-boy/girl pants on and walk the walk when it comes to bootstrapping and building a team, a product, a workplace. 

I had to wear many hats and adjust during these 3 years, initially learning what its like to work remotely, on top of building a small remote team, grew from lead designer to being director of design for product and managing marketing and seo teams. Companies have now been bought and sold, maybe not in the best way but now I'm in search for the next partner/client I can collaborate with. This is where Toptal comes in, which I think is leading the initiative in this space in looking for top talent and matching them with the right companies + the global community that comes with it all. My commitment and dedication to this craft, it was a no-brainer for me to try to get on board. 

If I'm accepted on the Toptal platform these are some of the qualities and skills I will bring to the table:
- **My Work Ethic**:
	- I'm known for being a perfectionist at almost everything I do with a great-passion for detail.
	- A very motivated and responsive individual, both in my studies and work I do. Reliable and always on time and ready to work.
	- I have excellent communication and team-building skills with professionals and non-professionals at all levels. 
- **Design Background**:
	- With my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Media Arts & Graphic Design, I have a strong sense and understand the value of Design.
	- An expertise when it comes to website & app design, responsive design, UI/UX design, prototyping user flow & wireframes.
	- I  have a deep understanding of front-end development(HTML,CSS,JS), and can marry the intersection of design and development. 
- **Marketing Experience**:
	- Worked with internal and third-party companies to implement marketing strategies and seo techniques. 
	- Developed email drips and marketing campaigns to increase customer retention and acquisition.
	- Insights into Google Analytics and KPI reports to monetize marketing spend on different channels.
- **Management Skills**:
	- Began as Director of Design and was promoted to VP of Operations for startup. I was in charge of managing small teams that consisted of daily standups and scrum/agile with development teams, facilitating daily calls with Marketing, Business Intelligence and Customer Service departments to go over weekly agendas and discuss on-going tasks.
	- Collaborated and worked side by side  CEO to provide weekly evaluations and overall business performance insights
	- Liaison between current relationships and vendors and explored areas and ways to run more efficiently.

Again, I have over 10 years experience designing products, helping companies from branding to web and product design. I provide the knowledge and know-how of what it takes to conceptualize an idea and bring that idea to fruition. I believe I will be a perfect candidate amongst the other **top 3%** of [Web UI/UX Designers][web-ui-ux] on the platform. I will be thrilled to work at an organization that **100%** supports remote work, this is the future, so here it is to giving a shot at becoming one of the elite!

Cheers! üçª
