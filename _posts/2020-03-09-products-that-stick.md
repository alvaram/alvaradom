title: "Three Things to Remember when Creating Products"
---

Taken from **Hiten's presentation at ProductCraft Conference**, co-founder of <a href="https://usefyi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FYI</a> and originally from this <a href="https://productcraft.com/perspectives/building-products-that-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> on ProductCraft.

Here are the three takeaways to remember:
- **Customer Journey** - make sure the product is part of the user's daily workflows, broken down into three time periods, one week, 2-4 weeks and 5+ weeks.
- **Customer Insights** - to do this, ask them how they're using your product, and put in buckets of short-term, mid-term and long-term retention timeframes
- **Customer Experiments** - the most important of them all, craft an ideal user experience piece by piece, add and iterate fast. Take baby steps and rinse and repeat.
